I've always been scared by malloc, with its seemingly complicated call and potential complications.
With this project I've decided to take the bull by the horns and see what lies behind malloc and its variations. 
It is a very challenging project, but I am learning a lot about writing big and efficient programs in C, 
working with pointer arithmetic and memory blocks.
